Primary key :
            Primary key is key by the using of it we can identify a unique row .



Foreign Key : whenever we use a anther tables Primary key into any filed that will  
                call foreign key


create table tableName
(
    abc char(5)
    foreign key (abc) reference anotherTableName(Primary key row name ) 
)


Create Three table and make some connection over there 


create table student (
    roll varchar(5) Primary key,
    name varchar(30)
)

create table course (
    courseNo varchar(6) Primary key,
    courseName varchar(39)

)
create table enroll (
    roll varchar(5),
    courseNo varchar(6),
    date Date 
    foreign key roll reference student(roll)
    on delete cascade,
    foreign key courseNo reference course(courseNo)
    on delete cascade
)

if we want to delete the form the reference table they don't alow you to delete it 
so we have to use that (on delete cascade ) after make the relation with another 
table foreign key....*** then when we delete Primary key row the foreign key will be
delete automatically ..
