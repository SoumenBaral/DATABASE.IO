    Top Down                                      Bottom Up




    Top Down: top will be model and Down will be Data

                ex: if we want to make a database then first we have to think about
                    the model of the the hospital doctor section the management section
                    the patient , recaption and so on then we have data the data .
    
    Bottom Up : It's totally opposite of the Top Down . Data first then make a model model
