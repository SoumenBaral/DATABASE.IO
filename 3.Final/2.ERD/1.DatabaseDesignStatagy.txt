    Top Down                                      Bottom Up




    Top Down: top will be model and Down will be Data

                ex: if we want to make a database then first we have to think about
                    the model of the the hospital doctor section the management section
                    the patient , recaption and so on then we have data the data .
    
    Bottom Up : It's totally opposite of the Top Down . Data first then make a model model



    ** Requirement analysis: what type thing are Require 

    ** What not to do : 
    1. Redundancy : Don't repeat more then on column to another table because 
                    we can all the data from i common think
    
    2.Incompleteness: need to take same row and colum on to another table
