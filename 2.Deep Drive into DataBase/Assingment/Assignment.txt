	 DataBase Assignment –2



Q1..Write the difference between Primary Key and Composite Primary Key

Primary key ::
                Primary key is a unique vale of the field all value will be unique

Composite Primary key :
                if there is not a unique field in the table their we use two or more  value   
                from different field to make  a unique key (csc111,Du) (csc111,Bup)


Q2. Write the difference between using JOIN Query and not using JOIN query


Without using join: We simply use select ,from and where , Select is for what we want  to show from is for which table we take and where is a conditional statement .
Without join’s complexity is so high whenever it ran it take time for running The Operation is—----------------------> (M x N)
------------------------------

Example : 

select employees.first_name,departments.department_name
from employees,departments
where departments.department_id = employees.department_id;

JOIN :       When we use join the comparison will be reduced Then it not will be 
(  N x M) and the  database will be first  Database internally make a function any compare at once not compare single single value ..

Example :
select employees.first_name,departments.department_name
from employees join departments 
on employees.employee_id = departments.department_id;

Q3..
Create a table of Employees which has the following fields
First Name
Last Name
Date of Birth
Department Id
Salary
Create a table of Departments which has the following fields
Department Id
Department Name
Create both of the tables using proper constraints


Ans :...........................................................................

CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES(
    FIRST_NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LAST_NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    DATE_OF_BIRTH DATE,
    DEPARTMENT_ID CHAR(2),
    SALARY INT,
    PRIMARY KEY(FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME)
);
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENTS(
	DEPARTMENT_ID CHAR(2) PRIMARY KEY,
    DEPARTMENT_NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);


INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES(FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DATE_OF_BIRTH,DEPARTMENT_ID, SALARY) VALUES ("SOUMEN ","BARA;",'1997-05-21','10',10000);
INSERT INTO DEPARTMENTS (DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME) VALUES ('50',"IT");
