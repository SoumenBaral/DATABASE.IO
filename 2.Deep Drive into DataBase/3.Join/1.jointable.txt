when we a made a table by joining two  or more table the we call it a join table 


we want to create a new table colum will me first Name from employee and department name form departments

solve it without using join ::
------------------------------

select employees.first_name,departments.department_name
from employees,departments
where departments.department_id = employees.department_id;


## Using joint we solve it 
--------------------------------

select employees.first_name,departments.department_name
from employees join departments on employees.employee_id = departments.department_id;

-------------------------------------------
Another approach:
-------------------------------------------

select employees.first_name,departments.department_name
from employees join departments using(department_id);


----------------------------------------------------------

Type of join:

1. Inner join: Inner join is as only common elements join 

2.Left Join : common of two tables and Left table will be output

3.Right join : common of two tables and Right table will be output

4.CrossJoin : common uncommon all will be in the output table 

5.Self Join: it will in on its own table one colum to another colum joining
