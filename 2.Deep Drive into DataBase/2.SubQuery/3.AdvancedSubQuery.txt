Question : Get the Second Height salary holder form the employee table?


Way 1 : fist we get distent and then set limit 1 and skip 1 then we got our expected value 

select * 
from employees
where salary = (
				select distinct(salary)
				from employees
				order by salary desc
				limit 1
				offset 1	
                    );

This not efficient way to solve ;
